    const data = {
      identity: {
        "I'm not enough.": {
          static: "⚠️ Static: Worth distorted by performance.",
          signal: `📡 Signal: This belief carries a quiet distortion that’s been echoing in most of us since childhood. It’s not loud — but it’s heavy. It says your worth is measured by effort, achievement, or acceptance. It turns your identity into a scoreboard.
  
  But signal tells a different story. Worth isn’t a prize for getting things right — it’s a gift woven into the code of your being. You weren’t made to earn it. You were made to remember it. You are not a project that needs fixing or proving. You’re already valid — not because of what you do, but because of who made you.
  
  In the Informational Genesis Matrix, signal is relational truth — encoded before performance, confirmed through alignment. You can’t fake what God already embedded. The real fraud isn’t your presence — it’s the belief that your wholeness has to be earned. You are not an impostor. You are an unfolding signal in real time.`
        },
        "I feel like a fraud.": {
          static: "⚠️ Static: Impostor syndrome is borrowed distortion.",
          signal: `📡 Signal: This belief is not your fault — it’s an echo. An echo of systems that rewarded performance over presence. An echo of spaces that celebrated your output but never affirmed your being. It’s easy to internalize that you’re only accepted for what you do — so when the masks come off, you're left wondering if love will stay.
  
  But you’re not pretending. You’re participating. You’re becoming. And that tension you feel? It’s not deception. It’s expansion. It’s what it feels like to step into something holy while still learning to trust that you belong there.
  
  In the Informational Genesis Matrix, signal is relational truth — encoded before performance, confirmed through alignment. You can’t fake what God already embedded. The real fraud isn’t your presence — it’s the belief that your wholeness has to be earned. You are not an impostor. You are an unfolding signal in real time.`
        },
        "Who even am I anymore?": {
          static: "⚠️ Static: When you forget your signal, noise fills the space.",
          signal: `📡 Signal: This question doesn’t mean you’re lost — it means something old is being dismantled. The truth is, you may have never been fully allowed to be yourself in the first place. You were handed roles, expectations, filters. And now that they’ve cracked, you’re finally hearing what’s underneath.
  
  Identity isn’t a name tag — it’s a frequency. In IGM, signal is the structure of truth, not just for the universe, but for your soul. You are not the performance. Not the personality traits that helped you survive. Not the story they wrote for you. You are resonance waiting to be remembered.
  
  Who are you? You are someone God loved before you had words. You are someone encoded with meaning that no title could ever replace. You’re not falling apart — you’re falling back into who you were before the world told you otherwise. That’s not confusion. That’s clarity, beginning to hum.`
        }
      },
      urgency: {
        "I'm behind in life.": {
          static: "⚠️ Static: Time measured in shame is not sacred.",
          signal: `📡 Signal: This belief usually doesn't start with you. It starts when someone else’s timeline becomes your benchmark. When success is defined by pace, not purpose. When presence gets sacrificed on the altar of productivity.
  
  But you're not late. Not to your life. Not to your healing. Not to your becoming. IGM teaches us that reality is relational — meaning time itself bends to what love is doing in you. The kingdom of God is not a sprint — it’s a return.
  
  There is no divine spreadsheet you’re failing to keep up with. The fact that you’re aware, that you’re pausing to listen — that’s resonance. You’re not measured by miles. You’re defined by movement toward alignment. What looks like delay may be the most sacred pacing of your life. You’re not behind. You’re just no longer hurrying away from yourself.`
        },
        "I can't slow down.": {
          static: "⚠️ Static: Urgency is the ego’s oxygen.",
          signal: `📡 Signal: This thought arises when your nervous system has confused speed with safety. When slowing down feels like danger, it’s not laziness you fear — it’s collapse. We live in a culture that baptizes burnout and rewards performance, so it makes sense that stillness feels foreign.
  
  But signal doesn’t rush you. It doesn’t shout deadlines or whisper shame. It invites you to ground. To rest. To realign. IGM teaches that reality itself is relational signal — not chaos, not scramble. And when you begin to listen beneath the static of urgency, you’ll notice the still small voice was never silent. You were just too fast to hear it.
  
  Slowing down is not weakness — it’s wisdom. It’s how you make space for signal to reach you again. The world wants you hurried. God wants you whole.`
        }
      },
      control: {
        "If I don't hold it together, everything falls apart.": {
          static: "⚠️ Static: Control is often a trauma reflex posing as responsibility.",
          signal: `📡 Signal: You’ve walked through noise long enough to know it doesn’t satisfy.
  
  You’re not broken. You’re brave. Because it takes courage to admit you’ve been listening to distortion — and even more to start unlearning it.
  
  Maybe you’ve believed things that kept you small. Maybe performance felt safer than presence. Maybe trauma taught you to filter truth through fear. And still… something in you showed up to this space. That matters more than you know.
  
  You’re already doing holy work — not by fixing yourself, but by noticing what feels misaligned. That’s how signal returns. First as a flicker. Then a rhythm. Then a hum that pulls you back toward center.
  
  You are not too late to tune in. You are not too far to feel resonance again. The signal isn’t asking for your perfection — only your permission to keep listening.`
        },
        "I need to fix this or it'll stay broken.": {
          static: "⚠️ Static: Fixing isn't the same as healing.",
          signal: `📡 Signal: When you believe this, you're carrying the weight of resolution on your back. You’ve been taught that silence means failure and delay means neglect. So you rush in to fix what’s wrong — even if it’s not yours to carry.
  
  But not everything broken needs a solution. Some things need a witness. Some things heal slower because they were fractured deeply — not because you’re doing something wrong. IGM reminds us that signal is not about control — it’s about connection. Control often tries to manufacture peace. But signal waits for it to rise organically.
  
  You’re not called to be a fixer. You’re called to be faithful. And healing often begins not with the answer, but with a surrendered presence. You don’t have to hold everything together. That was never the assignment.`
        }
      },
      expectation: {
        "I should be further along by now.": {
          static: "⚠️ Static: 'Should' is the sound of someone else's signal overpowering yours.",
          signal: `📡 Signal: “Should” is often disguised as drive, but it carries the residue of shame. It creates a false standard — usually someone else's — and turns your sacred unfolding into a metric.
  
  But signal doesn’t say “should.” Signal says “now.” It says, this is the moment you’re in, and I’m with you here.
  You were never meant to track your growth by comparison. IGM teaches that growth isn’t linear — it’s relational. It's informed by connection, not clocks.
  
  You may not be where you expected — but expectations can be rooted in distortion. You are not falling short — you are deepening. Your roots are going down. What you're becoming can't be measured by milestones. It will be revealed in the fruit of peace. You are exactly where your soul knows how to hear again.`
        },
        "I can't disappoint them.": {
          static: "⚠️ Static: Expectations unspoken are distortion unfiltered.",
          signal: `📡 Signal: This belief sounds noble — but it’s laced with fear. Fear that love is conditional. That value is fragile. That your goodness depends on your ability to meet needs you were never asked to carry.
  
  But you’re not here to manage their comfort. You’re here to carry signal. IGM reminds us that truth is relational, not transactional. That presence is more powerful than performance. When you stop contorting to avoid disappointment, you make room for authentic love to emerge.
  
  Yes, some people might feel let down. But you weren’t designed to be their savior. You were designed to be yourself. Disappointment is often a doorway to honesty. And honesty, when spoken in love, brings everyone back to resonance.
  
  You can’t control how others feel. But you can walk aligned — and alignment always brings peace, even if it disturbs the static around you.`
