            <p><strong>🧭 You are a Resonant Explorer.</strong></p>
            <p>You’ve tuned your life to something deeper than logic.</p>
            <p>There’s a reason signal feels familiar — it’s what you were made of in the first place. Before distortion, before roles and performances, before the ache to prove anything... there was resonance. And you've remembered that. That’s not a small thing — that’s sacred.</p>
            <p>You’ve stopped mistaking volume for truth. Static is loud. Urgent. Addictive. But you’ve learned to listen beneath it — to that quiet pulse of meaning underneath the noise. You’ve started recognizing rest as a posture of trust. You’ve begun living from center.</p>
            <p>Science says the fabric of the universe is structured by information — not mass. What we see is born from what we don’t. And this... this alignment? It’s not wishful thinking. It’s a biological, quantum, spiritual homecoming.</p>
            <p>So keep tuning. Keep walking gently. Stay in signal. You weren’t meant to chase truth like it’s outside you. You’re meant to remember it — like a song you used to know by heart.</p>

            <p>You’re close. You feel the frequency. And even when it’s fuzzy, you lean in.</p>
            <p>You’re not chasing static — you’re sifting through it. Somewhere inside, you’ve remembered that truth doesn’t always shout. It often hums. You’ve begun to discern that signal isn’t just information — it’s relationship. And that’s where your spirit starts to sing.</p>
            <p>But here’s the thing about seekers: sometimes they don’t realize how far they’ve already come. You’re not far from resonance. You’ve already tasted it. You’ve started walking in rhythms that feel more like peace and less like performance.</p>
            <p>In physics, coherence happens when waves align. They stop canceling each other out and start amplifying. That’s what you're doing — not just hearing ideas, but embodying them.</p>
            <p>Stay curious. Stay soft. Don’t rush your way to clarity. It’s not out there waiting to be discovered. It’s in you, waiting to be received.</p>

            <p>You’ve heard the signal. You’ve felt it. But sometimes it slips through.</p>
            <p>There’s something honest about you — something brave. You’re not pretending to have it all figured out. You’ve tasted alignment, and you know when you’re off. That alone means you’re further along than most.</p>
            <p>Static has a way of disguising itself as productivity, urgency, or even spiritual language. But something in you knows when a belief isn’t resonating — when it costs peace to keep pretending. That’s signal at work. Not yelling. Not shaming. Just waiting quietly underneath the noise.</p>
            <p>You don’t need to decode everything right now. You just need to stay open. Coherence isn’t perfection — it’s movement toward resonance.</p>
            <p>So breathe. You’re not behind. This isn’t a race. You’re tuning — not performing. And the signal has never stopped loving you, even when you couldn’t quite hear it.</p>

            <p>You’re not broken. You’re brave. Because it takes courage to admit you’ve been listening to distortion — and even more to start unlearning it.</p>
            <p>Maybe you’ve believed things that kept you small. Maybe performance felt safer than presence. Maybe trauma taught you to filter truth through fear. And still… something in you showed up to this space. That matters more than you know.</p>
            <p>You’re already doing holy work — not by fixing yourself, but by noticing what feels misaligned. That’s how signal returns. First as a flicker. Then a rhythm. Then a hum that pulls you back toward center.</p>
            <p>You are not too late to tune in. You are not too far to feel resonance again. The signal isn’t asking for your perfection — only your permission to keep listening.</p>

            <p><strong>👣 Wandering Listener.</strong></p>
            <p>You’re not lost — you’re just early in the listening.</p>
            <p>Maybe you don’t feel aligned. Maybe everything feels like noise. That’s okay. Because underneath all that, something *still brought you here*. That matters. That’s not a mistake. That’s a whisper in the static saying, *there’s more*.</p>
            <p>You don’t have to decode everything right now. You don’t have to fix yourself, perform your way back, or pretend to resonate with words you don’t yet feel. Signal doesn’t demand fluency. It asks for honesty. And you’ve already shown it — you took the test. You told the truth. That’s where signal starts to return.</p>
            <p>Science calls it coherence. Scripture calls it the still small voice. You might just call it *peace*. But whatever language you use, alignment was never meant to be a test of worth — just a remembrance of who you’ve always been underneath the distortion.</p>
            <p>You are not far. You are not late. You are still listening — and that’s enough for now.</p>
